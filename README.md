## üìù Project Explanation

### Overview

This project is a **real-time collaborative text editor** that allows multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously. It uses **Yjs** for real-time synchronization and **WebRTC** to manage peer-to-peer connections. The editor is powered by **Monaco Editor**, which provides an advanced and rich code editing experience similar to **Visual Studio Code**.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Users can join the same room and edit the text simultaneously. Changes are reflected live for all participants.
- **Cursor Synchronization**: Each user has their cursor represented in the editor, with their name and color.
- **WebRTC-based Signaling**: Peer-to-peer connections are made via WebRTC to sync changes directly between users without needing a server-based backend.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the frontend.
- **Monaco Editor**: A powerful code editor, used to provide rich editing features.
- **Yjs**: A real-time collaboration framework for syncing the document.
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer communication between users.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering (SSR) and optimized performance.
